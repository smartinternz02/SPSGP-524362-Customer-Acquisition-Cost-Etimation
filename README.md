## 1.1 Overview
Customer acquisition can be quite a challenging task in today’s world, mostly due to the fact that businesses face intense competitions from rival companies for the same target audience. To fight the competition, they have to formulate marketing strategies and tactics in order to stand out and attract customers. Besides, it can be quite challenging to entice a potential customer to buy your product from a wide range of choice offered to him / her. This project aims to use Machine Learning algorithms to predict the cost of acquiring a new customer based on the data of about 60,000 existing customers based on multiple factors such as the products sold, store features, income of the customer, etc.
## 1.2 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyse existing consumer behaviour and understand what appeals to them and on the basis of this information gathered, predict the cost of acquiring new customers.
